# Eventlite
This is a functional clone (**not styled to look nice! just backend.**) of Eventbrite, a site where users host events and have other users sign up. My goal in creating this site was to learn more about many-to-many relationships - events can have many attending users, and each attending user can attend many events. To create this association, I had to create a join table which contained keys to both attendees and events and allowed both to access each other
